Everyone in the tech world seems to review things they buy, and when you are a new parent you buy a lot of things. Also parents like to give advise. So here are my reviews and my advise.

## Eating
We are breast feeding. The pillows were helpful, I would recommend both [boppy] & [my breast friend]. 

### Bottles

My wife does work so I need to feed the kid, I don't have the equipment built in so I need some help. Our kid transfers extremely well from breast to bottle. We use the [Tommee Tippee] bottles. 

Something about coalic.

I would also recommend a used bottle warmer. They are very convenient in that they tell you when they are done, but its easy enough to use a tea kettle and a mug that I would not spend the money on a new one. 

## Sleeping

## Out and About
