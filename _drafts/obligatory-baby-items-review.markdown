Everyone in the tech world seems to review things they buy, and when you are a new parent you buy a lot of things. Also parents like to give advise. So here are my reviews and my advise.

## Eating
We are breast feeding. The pillows were helpful, I would recommend both [boppy] & [my breast friend]. 

### Bottles

My wife does work so I need to feed the kid, I don't have the equipment built in so I need some help. Our kid transfers extremely well from breast to bottle. We use the [Tommee Tippee] bottles. 

Something about coalic.

I would also recommend a used bottle warmer. They are very convenient in that they tell you when they are done, but its easy enough to use a tea kettle and a mug that I would not spend the money on a new one. 

### Milk collection
if you have a catch (like?) early on. You can collect the spare milk rather then just put in pads. By about six weeks (when things settle down) you can have a good freezer supply of milk. We did not do this, but my wife wished we had. 

## Sleeping

### Bassinet

### Swaddle

Some swaddles you can't change a diaper in the middle of the night. I know that you don't do this often, but it does happen; why would you want to also unswaddle the kid?

## Playing 
He likes everything just as much as the other, especially parent fingers.
### Swing

## Out and About
### Baby Carrier

### stroller
having stroller that works with an infant is great. And with laying flat we don't have to worry about how long he is in it like you do if he stayed in the car seat.

## Diapering
Cloth are amazing and not to difficult. Try a serves.

![Flip diaper cover image](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.cottonbabies.com%2Fflip%2Fdiapers%2Fcover%2FFLIPcoverArmadillo500x500.jpg&f=1)
Flip is great and versital. Don't really need the double gusset. They are one size. Not too expensive. AND the elastic is also lined! Many others get wet or dirty. BUT they comically big on a newborn. They work but are comically big. 

Also like Capri. Get what you want, they all seem great, but Velcro in the washer sucks. Have as little Velcro as possible! and if you do, hope it has a nice storage spot so it does not mess things up in the wash (like the thirsties!).
