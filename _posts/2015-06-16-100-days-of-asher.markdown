My son turned 100 (days) yesterday. As a retrospective my wife and I took a photo (or something else) from each day and made a video. <!-- more --> Viewing the completed project I was shocked to see how much he has grown, developed and come into his own personality[^1].

[^1]: He is still growing in his personality. This morning I was able to have a tickle/giggle fight while he was waking up in his bassinet. It was great after a hard day yesterday.
