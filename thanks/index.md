title: "Thank You"
---

My life has been crazy, rough, and a bit confusing as of late. In this rocky point I am going to list five things that I am thankful for each day. 

My wife, then girlfriend, encouraged me to do this back in 2011. I did it for three months. I am starting again because I was encourage to do so by my pastor, Tara, when she preached on [Psalm 118].

[^1]: We did our budget and I am glad this one worked out; we will see later how August will work.
[^2]: There are those bands that you like one or two songs, via these playlists I have realized which of these band I actually like or if I only like these two. For example try [Fleetwood Mac] & [Steely Dan].
[^3]: Read fancy or fussy depending on what part of the Internet you are from.
[^4]: On a budget we don't just make a lot of coffee. This really is a treat.
[^5]: I wish I could place my finger on what part of this I really am thankful for. Maybe a less smelly kid? Maybe that fact we don' t do this parade every day?
[^6]: Taking a negative and turning it to a positive! The kid and the dog do not like suden, random, loud noises.
