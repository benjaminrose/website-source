title: "Thank You"
---

My life has been crazy, rough, and a bit confusing as of late. In this rocky point I am going to list five things that I am thankful for each day. 

My wife, then girlfriend, encouraged me to do this back in 2011. I did it for three months. I am starting again because I was encourage to do so by my pastor, Tara, when she preached on [Psalm 118].
