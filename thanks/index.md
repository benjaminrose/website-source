title: "Thank You"
---

My life has been crazy, rough, and a bit confusing as of late. In this rocky point I am going to list five things that I am thankful for each day. 

My wife, then girlfriend, encouraged me to do this back in 2011. I did it for three months. I am starting again because I was encourage to do so by my pastor, Tara, when she preached on [Psalm 118].

[Psalm 118]: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+118&version=NLT

 **Update:** On July, 14, 2015 I changed the rules. Before I would not repeat, EVER![^repeat] That seems to extreme. From now on, I will not repeat from the last seven days, but will try not to repeat within a given month.

[^repeat]: It also just got hard to keep track of all of these thanks.

**Update: 2015-07-23** I started this project as a challenge from my pastor; I continued it past a week because of how I felt emotionally. Now I am feeling more positive and this activity feels compulsory and forcing me to invest time in something that feels less needed and almost in the way. From here on, I will continue to look for things, but I will only add the big things to the list. I will also update the list at least once a week so this does not get lost in the shuffle of life in grad-school while having a baby.

* 2015-07-25
   - batteries for when the power goes out

[^1]: We did our budget and I am glad this one worked out; we will see later how August will work.
[^2]: There are those bands that you like one or two songs, via these playlists I have realized which of these band I actually like or if I only like these two. For example try [Fleetwood Mac] & [Steely Dan].
[^3]: Read fancy or fussy depending on what part of the Internet you are from.
[^4]: On a budget we don't just make a lot of coffee. This really is a treat.
[^5]: I wish I could place my finger on what part of this I really am thankful for. Maybe a less smelly kid? Maybe that fact we don' t do this parade every day?
[^6]: Taking a negative and turning it to a positive! The kid and the dog do not like suden, random, loud noises.
[^cry]: Ok so this cry was probably not for that, but maybe next time?
[^strangers]: This seems like a healthy mix, not too much but not to little.
[^7-15]: I did not write anything down, but it was a good day with many things to be thankful for. I did not want to interrupt my evening with an obligatory task.
[^tummy]: ask my wife for the photo.

## August 2015

    - opportunities 
* 2015-08-08
    - micro-dates[^microdates]

[^microdates]: These are "~15 mins" long dates with no tech, no talking about current issues. We have to spend time together. It reminds us of each other so we get back to fighting the battles in front of us with renewed energy and resolve. 

## September 2015

* 2015-09-11
    - my evening. The kid fell asleep when I did not expect it. I got a shower after a long day working in the heat, I got to play on the computer. I got an evening to vedge!
