title: About
---

Hello world, I am a graduate student at the [University of Notre Dame][nd-phys]. But that is what I do and I am more then just that. I love using technology, creating things, sharing with people, and most of all, I enjoy spending time with my wife, son, and puppy. 

## Science
I love my research in determining distances from photos[^research]. If you want to know more please visit my [professional] website.

## Technology
For work I code mostly in [python]. One of the reasons I enjoy my work is because I get to spending a lot of time on my mac. There is just so much it can do when you start making technology work for you. Other then work, I fiddle around with other things, and am always trying to learn. I would highly recommend theses sources: [MPU], [NosillaCast], [Bart Busschots], and [Leancrew]. 

## Creativity 
My whole life, I have always had a creative outlet. Currently my main creative outlet is photography. You can see my photos over on [flickr] or a sample below. I also play percussion[^1] and work on this website. I have had a long history of dance and playing a variety of instruments[^2]. I am married to a theatre major, so we try to go out and see theatre as much as possible, ever increasing my theatrical chops.

## Family
Finally I get to the most exciting part of my life. I am [married] to the most caring and understanding women there is. We met in [Heathrow] on a class trip; it's an interesting story. We have a dog, Chance, who is a registered therapy dog with [Therapy Dog's International][TDI]. You can follow him on [facebook][chance-fb]. Finally my son was born early spring 2015. For those who are fathers, I want to share a moment with you[^fathers]. One day, when my son was a few months old, while trying to put him to sleep, this song came on. It was a few days after my wife and I saw Ben Fold's live. Looking at my now sleeping child, thinking about my wife, and hearing this song, I was just overwhelmed by how lucky I am. I know that every father has had this moment, so remember how lucky you are.
